					<h1>About</h1>
				
					<p>Our founder, Owen Christensen, was tired of the average pizza place. Owen dreamed of a place that ensured quality, affordable pizza, and a good time all at once. It didn't take long for Owen to get to work. In 2022, he single-handedly built Owen's Pizza with his bare hands. Since then, Owen's Pizza has held the unofficial title of Best Pizza in SLO!</p>
